### Installation
Go to https://github.com/abbruzze/kernal64/releases/latest and download and unzip on your computer the latest version.
Be sure to have a jre (11 or above) in the path and launch:
- On Windows: **k64.bat**, **kscpu64.bat**, **k128.bat**, **vic20.bat** or **cbm2.bat**. If you want the shell support (for --help command line, for example) you should use --shell as first option.
- On Linux: **k64.sh**, **kscpu64.sh**, **k128.sh**, **vic20.sh** or **cbm2.sh**.

The scripts start java with the -server option for performance reason. It could happen that your Java installation does not support the server option. In this case edit the script and remove the -server option.

If you want to load a 16M REU modify the memory settings inside the start scripts: for example, you could set -Xmx128M.

- CIA major bug fixed that prevented ComaLand to work properly
- Color memory now handles the most significant nibble as the last nibble written by VIC: dadb (openio) test now works properly.
- Fixed sprite idle cycle read.
- Now it's possible to choose among 3 differente VIC palette
- Fixed a veeery old bug about irq/nmi timings. The bug caused some irq stable interrupt handling to malfunctioning cause of an additional random cycle. In some demo the bug is visible when an unexpected flickering appears.
- Normal Mode -> Warp Mode -> Normal Mode fixed. Fixed warp mode handling causing a delay to SID output. When resetting emulator or using warp mode and then normal mode SID emits output with a short initial delay.

### What's new in 1.5.1 (May 4th 2019)
- VIC: Improved invalid video modes.
- Fixed Cart type 5 (Ocean) for Vice test
- Dual SID: more addresses to choose from for second SID.
- C128 MMU: fixed page diverting issue when common RAM is enabled on bottom position.
- General minor bugs fixed

### What's new in 1.5.0 (Feb 3rd 2019)
- VIC: fixed den bit handling: now on $30 it's checked on every cycles
- VIC: fixed sprite idle cycle, now display internal bus
- REU: fixed transfer timings.
- Now, demo Bottom (REU) works fine (https://csdb.dk/release/?id=174066). Fixed also Treu Love, now works fine for 80% (https://csdb.dk/release/?id=144105)
- Game pad controller: changed thresholds, now PS4 gamepad works properly

### What's new in 1.4.9 (Dec 9th 2018)
- VICII 2Mhz mode partial support added. Now Risen From Oblivion for VIC has been improved and the moving image is shown. Cannot show the first image yet.
- New ROMs panel. Removed rom environment variable. Now the roms configuration can be saved as other settings.
- New drives settings panel. Now it's possible to change drives settings and load floppy from a floating window. Removed all drive settings from menu'
-  The keyboard layout can be changed and the user can take effects immediately without restart.
- New warp mode on loading
- New RS-232 handling. New GUI panel to configure rs-232 and to monitor signals. RS-232 general improvements. New Hayes Modem class to handle AT commands.
- Z80 cycle counting more accurate
- Added VDC interlace mode user option. Now the user can choose between normal interlace mode (with flickering) and automatic de-interlace mode (default).

### What's new in 1.4.8 (Oct 20th 2018)
**VDC improvements**
- Improved screen resolution and aspect ratio
- Different handling of borders: seems better than before but need more investigation
- Added handling of 16K/64K bit
- Fixed interlace bitmap color mode: seems a lot better than before. For sure need more investigation.
- Fixed double pixel mode in bitmap mode
- Added busy flag emulation on copy/fill operations
- HBlank is not yet implemented

**General**
- Improved cart button functionality for freezers: now the freezer will activate interrupt only if the CPU is in the fetching state.
- VIC BA requests skipped when 2Mhz mode is on
- Improved 1581 speed cycles in order to run fast loaders in C64 mode properly
- All disks now are write protected if the corresponding file on local drive is read-only
- New scala 2.12.7 libraries
- Changed keyboard handling of non-standard keys. Used extended key codes to handle non standard keys. Now the keyboard file layout is simpler. Old keyboard file layout does not work any more.

### What's new in 1.4.7 (Sep 10th 2018)

**Lots of improvements in VDC handling.**

- fixed 8x1 mode
- fixed monochrome interlaced mode
- fixed clocks needed to draw a line depending on several parameters and
not only by xchars_total
- improved x smooth handling
- most of the Soci's test run properly
- regs 34 & 35 not yet implemented, need more investigation
- added customization of VDC total scan line: the user can enter the
total number of CRT scan line instead of having 312 PAL lines. New menù under Settings -> Adjust display -> VDC scan lines
- VDC was not included in the MMU in C64 mode, so in C64 mode it was not possible to see VDC running
- light pen support added (can't be used with light pen mouse emulation)

**General**
- 2Mhz mode has been improved: the VIC refresh cycles are treated as I/O.
- minor bug fixing

### What's new in 1.4.6 (Aug 10th 2018)
- Minor bug fixing. Added more command line options (see them with --help). Fixed REU 128K.
- Added support for right shift key
- Rotation calibrated with a correction factor of 1.025: Now the rpm is about 300 and most of the non running demos now run properly
- Added test cart to execute test bench (Writing at $D7FF will force the emulator to exit with the given exit code)
- Keyboard Editor: fixed TAB key handling
- REU fixed minor bugs about FF00 management. Fixed 128K size broken reu.
- Digimax now the user can choose which is the sampling frequency. Now modplay runs properly (used 11K)
- 128 MMU fixed page1 pointer at startup

- Added settings saving: now you can save the (majority) of the current settings
- Added support for function rom "Megabit" (C128 only)
- Fixed minor bugs that prevented the restoring of main window's size
- Added new menus for display settings (aspect ratio, zoom, rendering)
- Modified the display rendering type in order to improve image quality
- Added command line options (--help does work on Linux based system, on Windows the kxxx.bat script must be modified to see the usage)
- Added new utility under Edit menù: List BASIC to editor. List the BASIC program stored in memory to the default external editor
- Added the Eject disk menù under File
- VDC window is now resizable

### A Scala Commodore 64 & 128 emulator

Written in the Scala language (http://www.scala-lang.org/) and available for any Java JRE 1.8 environment.

Here the main features:
* Cycle based: exact cycle emulation using the PAL frequency
* VIC emulation based on the Christian Bauer's article: "The MOS 6567/6569 video controller (VIC-II) and its application in the Commodore 64" and the VIC-Addendum.
* 6510 CPU full emulation (with illegal opcodes too). The user can choose between a cycle exact cpu and a faster cpu not cycle exact.
* CIA1, CIA2 chips emulation: almost full.
* IEC Serial Bus
* Keyboard: for key mapping I'll provide documentation
* SID chip: for this chip I used the RSID Java library by Ken Händel
* Joystick emulation for port 1 and 2: the joystick can be emulated via keypad or via an USB real joystick (thanks to jinput library)
* Commodore 1351 mouse emulation
* Light pen emulation
* Datassette: full emulation using TAP file (read/write)
* 1541 Drive: exact cycle emulation (read/write) using 6502 CPU (1Mhz). Supports D64 and G64. In the Settings menù it's possible to turn off the full drive emulation and turn on the faster one.
  Only the G64 format can be formatted by Dos, while for the D64, the emulator intercepts the format routine call and bypasses it, using a pre-formatted empty disk.
* Local drive emulation on device 10: choose a local directory and let it your drive 10.
* **Dropbox** drive emulation on device 10: connect your Dropbox account to Kernal64 and let access it using device 10!
* Cartridges emulation (some CRT types are not emulated). Supports CRT format.
* MPS803 printer emulation. Preview panel updated while printing.
* Fast program loading of PRG/T64 local file or D64's file entry.
* Debug panel for main CPU and for 1541's cpu (break point, step by step execution, disassembler, assembler, etc.)
* Component panel: shows all internal components while running
* Drag & Drop support
* REU support (128,256,512,16M)
* Support for external roms, both for C1541 kernal and C64 kernal. The roms must be put in the roms directory. Use the switches -Dkernal=rom name and -D1541_kernal=rom name (you can put JiffyDOS ROMS here, for example, to use the fastloader).
* Support for 1541-VIA1 <-> CIA2 parallel cable, used by many fastloaders. Tested on Speed Dos and Dolphin Dos 2.
* Support for 1541's expanded memory (tested with Dolphin Dos 2).
* RS-232 3-way UserPort implementations useful to connect with BBS on internet. The Telnet implementation can be used to connect to a telnet server (like BBSs); the TCP implementation can be used to connect with a generic TCP/IP server. The File implementation can be used to read/write to local files.
* RS-232 **SwiftLink** cartridge implementation. Tried with NovaTerm 9.6 and other terminal software. 
* ... and more
